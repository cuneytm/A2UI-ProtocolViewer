# A2UI Protocol Viewer ✨

A high-performance, real-time renderer for the **A2UI (Agent-to-UI) protocol**, powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. This project showcases an advanced multi-agent architecture where AI agents autonomously design and stream their own user interfaces.

## 🎬 Live Demo

*Watch the A2UI Protocol Viewer in action, featuring high-fidelity Cyber-Trail animations and real-time multi-agent UI orchestration.*

## 🚀 Features

- **Live System Architecture**: A real-time, high-fidelity topology map with "Cyber-Trail" animations showing the flow of data between User, Server, Coordinator, Agents, and Gemini.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A `Coordinator` agent synchronizes parallel streams from a `Market News Agent` and a `Market Data Agent`.
- **Streaming UI**: Progressive rendering of UI components as they are generated by the agents—no waiting for the full response.
- **Cyber-Trail Animations**: Advanced SVG animations using light trails and glowing paths to visualize network activity.
- **Deep Debug Console**: A professional-grade debugging interface with real-time SSE stream inspection, raw request context, and pretty-printed A2UI messages.
- **Responsive A2UI Renderer**: Automatic conversion of A2UI JSON messages into interactive charts (Chart.js), cards, and layout columns.

## 🛠️ Architecture

1.  **User**: Sends a natural language prompt (e.g., "Analyze ETH").
2.  **Server (Express)**: Manages SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections.
3.  **Coordinator (Gemini)**: Analyzes the prompt and delegates work to specialized agents.
4.  **Specialized Agents**: 
    *   **Market Data Agent**: Searches for price data and generates A2UI Charts.
    *   **News Agent**: Searches for current events and generates A2UI Article Cards.
5.  **Renderer**: A client-side JavaScript engine that interprets the A2UI protocol and paints the DOM.

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cuneytm/A2UI-ProtocolViewer.git
cd A2UI-ProtocolViewer
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file or export your key:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Run the App

## 📡 A2UI Protocol in Action

A2UI (Agent-to-UI) allows agents to control their own presentation. Instead of text, agents emit JSONL:

```json
{"surfaceUpdate": {"components": [{"id": "chart", "component": {"Chart": {"type": "line", "data": {...}}}}]}}
{"beginRendering": {"root": "chart"}}
```

The viewer renders these messages instantly, creating a fluid, agent-decided experience.
